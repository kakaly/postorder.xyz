# postorder.xyz

My personal blog. Cloned from [Dan Abramov's overreacted.io](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io). Syntax theme based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.

## Contributing Translations

You can translate any article on the website into your language!

**For a full example, see [this PR](https://github.com/kakaly/postorder.xyz/pull/15/files) translating a post into Turkish.**

Don't forget to add your language code to the `langs` header in the Markdown file (both original and translated versions). If you're the first one to translate a post to your language, you'll also need to add it to to the list in `src/utils/i18n.js`.
